Pointers in C++
Pointers in C++ are a symbolic representation of addresses. 
They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference and create and manipulate dynamic data structures.
Pointers store the address of variables or a memory location. 

Syntax
datatype *var_name; 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int x = 10; // variable declared
    int* myptr; // pointer variable
 
    // storing address of x in pointer myptr
    myptr = &x;
 
    cout << "Value of x is: ";
    cout << x << endl;
 
    // print the address stored in myptr pointer variable
    cout << "Address stored in myptr is: ";
    cout << myptr << endl;
 
    // printing value of x using pointer myptr
    cout << "Value of x using *myptr is: ";
    cout << *myptr << endl;
 
    return 0;
}

Value of x is: 10
Address stored in myptr is: 0x7ffd2b32c7f4
Value of x using *myptr is: 10
